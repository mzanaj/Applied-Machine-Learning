# Applied-Machine-Learning
This repository will have homework & notes regarding the master's course of "Applied Machine Learning." This course attempts to provide students with the application of ML techinques, while giving some of the main points and intuition, this course does not go indepth of the theory. Since I have covered the theory of these algorithms, in previous courses (Statistical Learning STATS 503), this course will allow me to further reinforce my understanding of these concepts, and as well get a better programming experience. In the past the focus has been on the theory, now the focus is in the implementation.
